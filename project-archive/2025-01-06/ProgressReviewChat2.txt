Jay
Mandashina.
Darshana
Darshana
00:59
Good morning, Jane.
Jay
Jay
01:00
How are you, buddy?
Darshana
Darshana
01:01
Yeah, I'm good. Hope you are doing good, too.
Jay
Jay
01:04
You're good, I like the positivity in your voice.
Darshana
Darshana
01:08
Yeah.
Haha.
So…
Yeah, let's start. Let me share my screen, based on the last conversation we had, I have…
I have, some progress to show you.
Jay
Jay
01:22
Great.
Darshana
Darshana
01:24
Thank you, Shameless.
Can you see my screen now?
Jay
Jay
01:38
Yes, yes I can.
Darshana
Darshana
01:40
Okay, Jay, so this is the,
Landing page, this is the, dashboard.
When you are, logging into the system.
So, this will be displayed as the first page.
So, at, at the end of the, project, I will give you,
What do you call a user login system?
Yeah, you will have a password to, see the go, I mean, to enter the…
application.
Jay
Jay
02:14
Great, looks good.
Darshana
Darshana
02:15
Yeah. So, I have uploaded the data there, so you just need to, select the date range.
Based on the date range, it will, showed you the, numbers.
So, currently, these are, updating based on the,
Previous data, previous calculation methods, so I'm in the process of changing those.
So, basically, what I wanted to,
inform you is this, data import, process is totally completed. Now, you can test the data by, browsing
this, and, add… Attendance data here.
And, payment data here.
And, after that, I have completed the, role manager as well.
Now, all the information that you have provided through an Excel file a few weeks ago.
Have added to this, list.
Now, these are, based on your actual, packages.
So everything has been uploaded now.
So, if you have anything, you just need to… you can, I mean, you can change it from there.
And also…
Jay
Jay
03:40
Quick question. How do I… if I was to do a fixed price, I just changed session price?
Darshana
Darshana
03:52
If you have a fixed price.
Jay
Jay
03:54
Yeah.
Fixed price per session.
Darshana
Darshana
04:00
yeah, fixed price by session means, yeah, you can… I mean, is there any difference there?
Jay
Jay
04:08
So, for example, like, this one's a good example. So you have 65 euros, right? Is that… that's how much it costs for a month, but for one class.
We don't have a number of sessions, right? So, we…
I'm not gonna pay 60.75 for one class, I would want to pay either a divided amount, but for this one, it's unlimited, so we're gonna do a…
fixed amount, let's say it's $260, would I put that in session price?
Darshana
Darshana
04:40
Yeah, I mean, this option is given for the scenarios like this.
See? Based on the laws…
Jay
Jay
04:49
Okay. So, can I… So here, can you just delete session price?
Does it automatically calculate that?
Darshana
Darshana
05:01
Yeah, automatically calculates that, based on the previous,
Jay
Jay
05:07
We don't include a number of sessions.
Will it… can I manually enter the session price?
Darshana
Darshana
05:15
Yes, for now, yes, if you want to, you know…
Jay
Jay
05:19
That's great, okay, perfect.
Darshana
Darshana
05:21
Okay. So, I wanted you to have, have a look and test.
with some of the data. Sorry, say again?
I mean, now you can, you know, use the file and see if you have any challenges by adding these data, adding data, when you are going to add new data. If you have any challenges, so if you need any modification, just let me know.
Now the, this, rule manager is ready.
That's great, okay. Yeah, just have a look, and let me know if you need any changes.
Jay
Jay
05:57
Looks… looks good for me for now. My, is it ready for me to start putting data in and testing?
Darshana
Darshana
06:04
Actually, yes, yes, that's what I mean. Okay. So, basically, the main packages I have added, if you can add a new package and see, that'll be great, then we don't need to, you know, add the packages again.
Okay, so you have provided me an Excel file a few weeks ago. Based on that only, I have added this information.
Jay
Jay
06:27
Yeah, and also, I need to add some more as well, because,
Darshana
Darshana
06:30
Yeah.
Jay
Jay
06:31
We've, yeah, we've changed things.
Darshana
Darshana
06:33
Just, just, Aden, let me know your feedback.
And for payment calculation, also, I have,
done the improvements that we have discussed. So, based on the payment data we have updated, it, verified now.
It is verifying, each and every record in that attendance, data.
Jay
Jay
06:59
So verification basically means I can match this to a payment.
Darshana
Darshana
07:04
Yes, exactly. It is automatically matched.
Okay. So, if the verified is yes, it is matched, and you can see the invoice number there.
Jay
Jay
07:14
Very good.
Darshana
Darshana
07:16
Yeah, so, in case if you need to check whether it is matching correctly, you just need to refer to the invoice number.
I have, tested a few of them as well. So, and also, the payment speeds will be there.
Jay
Jay
07:33
Okay, good. Now, that's excellent, well done. If there is…
a situation where I need to override for a coach.
Darshana
Darshana
07:42
Yeah.
Jay
Jay
07:42
Usually, it's for coaches where I've agreed a minimum rate. How do I go about that process?
Darshana
Darshana
07:48
Yeah, let me explain you one by one, and the next one I need to,
pay your attention is this one. So, if there is any, mismatching records of the payment records are not there. So, yeah, you will get verified as no.
So in that situation, You just need to click this verify button.
And there you will be see…
You'll be seeing the potential invoice numbers there. If there is any, you know, closely matching invoice number.
Okay.
I mean, unverified invoice number, with the amount, will be displayed here.
So, I just need to know, what are the actions that you need to take after this… after you're getting this information, so then I can, you know, program it.
Jay
Jay
08:46
So, on this one, what I would do is, I would say, manually input.
Darshana
Darshana
08:52
Okay.
Jay
Jay
08:53
And then I…
Darshana
Darshana
08:53
Manually input what, Jay? The amount, or the payment split? Yes.
Jay
Jay
08:59
Exactly, all, all amounts.
Darshana
Darshana
09:02
Okay, you need, like, empty row there, empty cells there, you just need to put the amounts.
Jay
Jay
09:08
Exactly.
Darshana
Darshana
09:09
Okay, I will do that.
So, there are, unverified data like this.
Jay
Jay
09:16
So you just need to, you know.
Darshana
Darshana
09:20
Just click verify, and also if, if…
There is any issue with the payment records,
You will get… get a notification.
So just, use the tool, Jay. I will do the amendments that we have discussed so far.
within a day, and by tomorrow, I will confirm you,
With the calculations that we just discussed.
Jay
Jay
09:47
Okay, excellent. So, I need to pay Adam today
So can we use him as our test cases, if possible?
Darshana
Darshana
09:58
Yeah, let's do that.
Jay
Jay
10:00
So I'd need to pay Adam for the period of…
all of, August, so from the 1st of August to the 31st, if… if it does go up to… does it go up to 31?
Yes, 1st to the 31st of August I need to pay Adam for.
Darshana
Darshana
10:18
Yeah, let's see how it comes.
First stop for this… So, PM1 data is not available for…
Jay
Jay
10:27
I can get you that. Give me one moment.
Darshana
Darshana
10:30
Okay.
Jay
Jay
10:37
I'll send it to you in Fiverr, so we have a record of it.
Darshana
Darshana
10:42
Okay.
Jay
Jay
10:44
So you need, attendance data for August?
Darshana
Darshana
10:51
Attendance data is already there, GA.
Yeah, yeah, if you can send me the book files…
Jay
Jay
10:57
updated for August, so yeah, I'll send that.
Is there any, particular file name
that I should use for our records for the two… the two files.
Darshana
Darshana
12:11
No, Jay, you just need to, you can update any file there.
Jay
Jay
12:15
Okay, fine.
Darshana
Darshana
12:16
So, it doesn't, yeah.
Jay
Jay
12:23
I'll just make it clear to you, so…
Darshana
Darshana
12:26
Now, let me, let me.
Jay
Jay
13:08
7 days is done.
Customer experience, oh, let's…
So we've got your payments data, just getting you your, customer attendance data as well.
Darshana
Darshana
14:15
Okay.
Jay
Jay
14:20
Wow, 880 in attendance is very good.
Okay, buddy, just click send.
Darshana
Darshana
16:15
Ja, okay, le…
Let me download the files.
Yeah, okay, let's upload it.
Jay
Jay
16:55
So, am I right in thinking, the historical pay data it will save…
So let's say I gave it to you in March.
Darshana
Darshana
17:05
Yeah, it seems like data appending.
Jay
Jay
17:07
And then it will add April, and add, and add, and add, so we don't have to create…
Darshana
Darshana
17:12
Yeah, there is a, there is a, little thing that I need to, you know,
highlight here, Jay, since we have, removed the data duplication process, now we will have to update, you know,
We'll need to make sure we don't add duplicate data manually.
Jay
Jay
17:34
Okay.
Darshana
Darshana
17:34
For example, if we had June 1st to June 30, Today, and,
Next month, you'll have to, make sure we don't duplicate June 30th, though, any June data there.
Jay
Jay
17:49
Okay.
Darshana
Darshana
17:50
So, if you have any mechanism, just let me know, then I can automate and add it to there. I just can't, you know, figure out a logic to, you know, remove the…
duplicate… real duplicates, and keep the duplicate records, because in our scenario, there are duplicate records which we need to, calculate them without, yeah, that's…
Jay
Jay
18:13
Yeah, so we have the, ones where we have the same invoice number.
Darshana
Darshana
18:17
Yeah.
Jay
Jay
18:18
On the same day.
Darshana
Darshana
18:20
Okay.
Jay
Jay
18:21
Cheech.
Darshana
Darshana
18:22
Yep.
So if you can, you know, figure out…
Jay
Jay
18:25
But we do a mechanism that's nowhere. So, I mean, I think it's very rare that I would do anything more than
10.
Do… like… In one month, I don't think there's gonna be more than 10 duplicate records.
So.
Darshana
Darshana
18:49
I don't think it's a good mechanism to depend on a number.
There. Because if something happens, it will cost you in dollars, so…
Jay
Jay
19:02
Yeah, well, I mean, I would say, if we see more than 10 duplicates, then I would like the system to say, are you sure this is… could you go back and check, this is the correct file, as we have more than 10 duplicates?
Darshana
Darshana
19:19
Maybe not.
Currently, we have a mechanism like,
cross-check the duplicates and separate it to a separate data table. So, I can do something like this. I can give you the access to that, and you can,
selective, those are, not duplicates, so need to add to the database. Yeah.
Jay
Jay
19:44
And then maybe also, if we could keep a separate record where I can say.
Payroll has been completed for this month.
this month, this month, and then, you know, for May, June, July, and then I can know, or maybe someone else can know if, if that data would then be duplicated.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Darshana
Darshana
20:09
Yeah, I got that, the only thing is…
We will need to, you know,
Arrange the data based on a date and time.
So if we, for example, if we have finalized the, payment data for August.
Jay
Jay
20:30
Yep.
Darshana
Darshana
20:30
We should block… Data inputting for, that complete.
Jay
Jay
20:35
Yes, yes, much better. That's a much better solution, yeah, good. So yeah, it should ask you, for what months am I entering this data for?
Darshana
Darshana
20:44
You might talk a little bit.
Jay
Jay
20:45
And then it should… it shouldn't really allow you to do the previous month if the payroll has been closed off for that previous month.
Darshana
Darshana
20:53
Okay, let's.
Jay
Jay
20:54
Then, yeah, then it kind of saves all the previous work.
Darshana
Darshana
20:58
Okay, I will do that.
Jay
Jay
21:00
Yeah, good idea, great, great.
Darshana
Darshana
21:02
Yeah, okay, now we have…
Jay
Jay
21:04
Okay, Justin, I think… I mean, for now, it's okay, but in the future, I think there's gonna be times where we realize, shit, we made a mistake, we might need to then unlock
unlock that info and amend it now.
Darshana
Darshana
21:17
That's the issue I was also thinking about. The thing is,
Yeah, the thing is that pre-increase… The development hours…
Okay. Yeah, let's, let's, let's talk about at the end, and let's finalize, discuss and finalize what we are going to do.
Jay
Jay
21:40
Yep.
Darshana
Darshana
21:40
I mean, we'll also…
Jay
Jay
21:42
That's very rare that that happens, so I'm also happy to just make manual amendments, which is fine.
Darshana
Darshana
21:50
Okay, let me think about if we have a, you know, easy mechanism to handle that situation. Yeah, great.
Yeah.
Let's add the payment data as well.
Okay…
Now let's import the data.
Okay, now the, August data has been imported.
So, there you will see a summary of the data import.
Jay
Jay
22:30
Very good.
Darshana
Darshana
22:31
Okay, there are two duplicate records identified and removed. Let's… Let's see that separately.
Now, let's go to the payment calculator.
Jay
Jay
22:49
So, in this scenario also, Dasha, so we've got the data in there, and
I'm going to update the rules later, so… will that be fine to do? And then I can click run, and it will calculate based on the new rules each time?
Darshana
Darshana
23:06
Yeah, exactly.
Jay
Jay
23:07
Okay, good. And I can do that as many times as I want. If I identify that…
Darshana
Darshana
23:11
Yeah, the… yeah, only thing is, Jay, if you are changing existing rule.
So, if we have used that rule in the past for calculations, those also going to be changed.
So the best scenario is… yeah.
Jay
Jay
23:28
That's not the end of the world, because…
Darshana
Darshana
23:34
I mean, if you can, instead of changing a rule, if you can add a new… add that as a new rule, then it'll be, it'll be, no issue for you.
Jay
Jay
23:43
Okay, good. So, alright, so we need new packages each time there's a change.
Darshana
Darshana
23:50
Yeah, yeah, if you can, yeah, that's a… I guess that's a good mechanism, because you will…
Have the same past records?
And,
We can even, you know, update the rules as a new, version of the same rule.
Jay
Jay
24:10
Okay.
Darshana
Darshana
24:11
So we'll have to use some kind of mechanism for that.
That's what I suggest, so if you need, if you need to change the, change and override the existing rule, that's also possible.
Jay
Jay
24:25
I think this is, yeah, a consideration you'll have to think about when
We… we talk about locking previous…
Darshana
Darshana
24:33
Jean.
Jay
Jay
24:34
Yeah.
Darshana
Darshana
24:35
Yeah, in that situation, we can change the existing rule. But, in database management, Jay, to be honest with you, we don't use that mechanism.
as a best practice, so that's what I, wanted to highlight that.
So, if your situation is different, we can go with that.
Jay
Jay
24:56
Yeah, I mean, I will remember, it's just, I fear that in the future, we have… we might have other managers that might…
Not realize what the… what the ramifications of changing a rule or a price.
Darshana
Darshana
25:13
Okay.
So, this is the result, verification, the, the, the, the, both files have, verified now.
Jay
Jay
25:24
So, let's…
Darshana
Darshana
25:26
Go with the instructor.
What's his name? So, you have a sorting, mechanism there.
Jay
Jay
25:33
Oh, that's excellent, good. We need to sort Adam, please.
Darshana
Darshana
25:38
I know.
Joking.
So, basically…
Jay
Jay
25:50
Yeah, this looks correct.
Darshana
Darshana
25:54
So let's, let's cross the, cross-check, A random, record.
Let's take this one.
Jay
Jay
26:07
The discounts mechanism, that's not in place yet, is it?
Darshana
Darshana
26:13
No. Discount mechanism, you mean, the, the payment, or it's under payment irrigation?
Figgo.
Jay
Jay
26:21
Okay.
Darshana
Darshana
26:22
Payment certification, oops.
Click verify the payments, so payments will be verified, and it'll, categorize the payments under tax.
And, fits a 100% discount.
Jay
Jay
26:40
I see.
Darshana
Darshana
26:43
Yeah.
So, for example, these two amounts categorized as…
100% discount, because the same amount is… so this is the scenario we discussed, right?
If it's a fee, it's undertax.
Jay
Jay
27:03
Yep, correct. Also, so there's two types of 100% discounts.
Basically, anything that says discount in the…
You know what, let's do this. I'll come back to you on that one, because,
Hold on. It was, you know, you know in the sheet that says, rules, or the original brief?
That tells you exactly how this mechanism works, because I have… three scenarios, right? .
Darshana
Darshana
27:37
Hmm?
Jay
Jay
27:37
So I have, 100% discount.
which is done under a certain code, usually it's mind-body switch. There, I would like you to treat it as if the discount doesn't apply.
There are situations where we have a less than 100% discount, so maybe 20%. There, I would like you to apply the discount to every single person, so MFC gets less, the coach gets less.
There are some where we have given out free classes. So, for example,
There was, like, box… and the code will have the word discount in it.
And in that case, I would like everyone to be paid nothing.
Darshana
Darshana
28:25
Okay, so.
Jay
Jay
28:27
And, I… the way to distinguish
Them is in that document, the original brief, or the rules document?
Darshana
Darshana
28:38
Okay.
Order was a good girl.
Jay
Jay
28:46
I think, yeah, brief.doc, we'll have it.
Darshana
Darshana
29:13
Okay, let me check that, that document, first, Jay. I remember that you have mentioned these scenarios. Yeah. So,
So, you say, is there any indication in this memo field where I can find those three scenarios?
Jay
Jay
29:30
Yeah, so, for example… I think Franvilla?
Invoice number 795.
Darshana
Darshana
29:40
Yeah?
Jay
Jay
29:42
boxing discount.
Hmm…
Darshana
Darshana
29:45
Yeah.
Jay
Jay
29:46
Why? Why? I do not remember making a code like that. Bear with me.
Darshana
Darshana
30:01
So, what we want to do is, first of all, we'll remove the 100% discount, and identifying a mechanism to exclude other discounts as well.
And then start the verification process, right?
But you have another scenario where, the payment will be, goes to coaches.
Jay
Jay
30:32
Based on a…
Darshana
Darshana
30:35
Based on a pre-desired percentage, right?
Jay
Jay
30:39
Yes. Let me do this. I'm gonna make you a flow chart to help you understand exactly. Give me… give me 30 minutes, and I'll send it to you.
Darshana
Darshana
30:49
Okay, if you have already given that information to me, you just need to tell me, so then I can begin, you know, check the information. So you don't want to repeat the same thing.
Jay
Jay
31:01
I don't mind. To be honest, I need to double-check, my…
Because I've created new discount codes since then, and I need to make sure that they all fit the same pattern.
Darshana
Darshana
31:12
Okay.
Jay
Jay
31:13
I'll give you an updated version.
Darshana
Darshana
31:16
Yeah, just let me know if my understanding is correct on this one. So, first of all, we will, do the payment verification, and remove whatever the payments that are under discounts, and then only we just need to, verify the records with, attendance, right?
Jay
Jay
31:35
Hmm, I'm not following you on this one, so…
I would say, my understanding is, you input those two spreadsheets, you try and link all the records together, so link and attendance with a payment amount.
Then, there'll be a process where, obviously, we have to verify certain records if we can't, find the payment data. And then, number two, we're looking into the discounts, so…
as I said, there's 3 types of discount. One is where 100% has been applied, but actually we need to treat it as a, as if there's no discount.
And there is, another situation where a 100% discount has been applied, and we need to treat it as completely free.
And then there's another discount where it's anything less than 100%, and then we need to proportionately, apply payments to all parties involved.
Darshana
Darshana
32:39
Okay, so how about this, since the, since this mechanism is built, total for payment,
information finalization. So, as the first step, I will get the payment verification file.
and remove all the discount information from there before I, you know, compare with attendance certification.
Jay
Jay
33:03
Okay. I think that's a good way of making sure that, yeah, that the base is correct, and then the discount stuff is a separate thing.
Darshana
Darshana
33:09
Yeah.
Jay
Jay
33:10
Yeah, and then also, if you go back to the rules section, Dashana, because maybe this might mess things up, because…
If, so, for example, yeah, like, adult 10-pack, 15-pack, that is discountable.
So, the price may change based on the… Discount. You following me?
Darshana
Darshana
33:35
Yeah, how do we identify the discount for that?
Jay
Jay
33:39
So, I would say that we should have a rule
I mean, we shouldn't have a price there, unless the price is fixed.
The rule should be, we divide the price by 15.
Darshana
Darshana
33:54
Yeah.
Jay
Jay
33:55
Yeah.
Darshana
Darshana
33:58
So, how does the discount, risk going to be applied?
You mean if we… if, for example, if we give a 10% discount for this package, so the, base price would be,
Reduced 15% from this one. Yeah. And then divide the dip by 15 to get this final price.
Jay
Jay
34:23
Exactly.
Darshana
Darshana
34:24
Okay.
Jay
Jay
34:26
So, I…
Darshana
Darshana
34:26
I think…
Jay
Jay
34:27
That it should pick up the actual price paid for the package, rather than a fixed amount that it's expecting.
Darshana
Darshana
34:38
Okay, is there any possibility that we can, add the correct amount here, without the discount?
Jay
Jay
34:46
Yes, I mean, it depends on how the mechanism works. So, I mean, I… yeah, I can have the usual price there, but then the system needs to pick up and treat the discounted amounts differently.
So maybe we include that here, and then later it says.
If you can see that it's been discounted, and we are actually applying the discount, then we take the new amount and divide that by 15 to get the actual session price.
Darshana
Darshana
35:15
Okay, is that, discount percentages, consistent for this package.
I think it's wife.
Jay
Jay
35:25
No, I mean, there's gonna be lots of different discounts applying to lots of different packages.
Darshana
Darshana
35:31
I mean, the, the, the, the, this, if we take, this package as example.
Jay
Jay
35:36
Yeah.
Darshana
Darshana
35:36
So, the percentage amount will be fixed for that package.
Or, inside the package, the discount can be changed.
Do you…
Jay
Jay
35:48
We may have… we may have a 10% discount that we give out, we might give a 15% discount.
Darshana
Darshana
35:56
No, I mean, inside the package, for a single package, you will have different, discount percentages.
Jay
Jay
36:05
Yes, potentially, yeah, it depends which customer we're giving it out to. We have some corporate customers who are on 20%, maybe, some other customers who are on 10%.
Darshana
Darshana
36:15
Yeah, then, we cannot manage it from here.
from Role Manager, we'll have to find different mechanism.
Because this is rather, all package information is saved, so if the percentage is,
Not consistent, and and depending on the package, we'll have to manage that separately.
Jay
Jay
36:41
Okay.
And then also.
Darshana
Darshana
36:43
So, do you have that information in the payment data or at interest data file?
Jay
Jay
36:48
The discount…
Darshana
Darshana
36:50
Only… yeah, the percentage?
Jay
Jay
36:52
Give me a moment… I think it's… It's definitely in the,
payments, I will just double check.
Darshana
Darshana
37:03
Let me open that file.
Jay
Jay
37:10
Yeah, yes, it's under the memo section, under the payment data.
Darshana
Darshana
37:16
Okay.
So, can you give me an example, then I can…
Jay
Jay
37:21
So, let's say… Sanam.
She has, on the 2nd of August.
She has a loyalty one-to-one single-class discount.
Darshana
Darshana
37:35
So, what's the name?
Jay
Jay
37:36
Sanam? S-A-N-E-M.
Darshana
Darshana
37:47
Okay, these are… Oh, under the memo, yeah, so you can see these two… these three records are all linked.
Jay
Jay
37:53
So she paid $2.29 in taxes.
And then… so, basically, Dasha, the story here is, we have,
I had a customer who came in a month before, and I quoted her a price of 35 euros for a class, and then later the price had gone up to 40 euros.
Darshana
Darshana
38:16
Okay.
So… So, I think we have a, logic there to capture the actual amount.
So, if we take this in invoice number.
Jay
Jay
38:30
Yep.
Darshana
Darshana
38:32
And this amount is also, we need to remove that, right?
This is…
Jay
Jay
38:36
That one, we always ignore that, yeah, correct?
Darshana
Darshana
38:39
Ja, then, this 37 should be, I mean, if we take the,
Total amount for that particular invoice.
Then it'll be, okay, right?
Jay
Jay
38:53
Yes, exactly.
Darshana
Darshana
38:55
So, this, scenario, we should consider the package as 32, and if, this have multiple sessions, so we'll need to divide this by number of sessions.
Jay
Jay
39:07
Yep, exactly. Boom. You got it.
Darshana
Darshana
39:11
Okay, let's do that. So, I will, you know…
Keep that in mind, and okay.
Jay
Jay
39:17
So, my understanding is, you're gonna have the standard logic for anything that doesn't Have a discount?
And then you'll We'll find…
Darshana
Darshana
39:27
I mean, not discount the J. The logic was, if we have any minus amount in the amount, that will be, divided, that will be reduced.
From the totally noise. Yeah.
Do you have any, you know, you see any, issue in that logic?
Considering any discount or anything like that, I just remove the minus values from the total invoice.
And then divide it to, the number of sessions.
Jay
Jay
40:01
Yeah, so there, there, like I said, there's, there's 3 scenarios.
And you can… basically, a lot of the discount codes have the word discount in them, the ones that are actual discounts.
Darshana
Darshana
40:15
Yeah, I understand that. So, what I'm asking is, without considering that, discount thing in the memo.
Memo description.
Jay
Jay
40:24
Yep.
Darshana
Darshana
40:25
If it's a hundred… if it's a 100% discount, you will have a minus 37 here.
So that scenario is also covered.
Right?
Jay
Jay
40:36
Yeah, so in that situation, there's either one of two scenarios, so either it is actually free.
if it has the word discount in it, then it means the class was free, and I wouldn't like no one to get paid. Or, it means that they were… they had purchased the package with our previous app.
And then that's usually under the discount code of, TEAMUP SWITCH.
And in that case, they are paid as usual, as per the usual rules.
Darshana
Darshana
41:10
So, do you have any example in this file?
Jay
Jay
41:12
Yes, so, you see where it says mind-body switch?
Antonio Sena?
Darshana
Darshana
41:19
This one.
Jay
Jay
41:20
Yep, that's a good one. So, hmm…
Darshana
Darshana
41:31
Yeah, for this scenario also, the logic, I said this, applicable, right?
Jay
Jay
41:38
Second W. Yeah, so, if it's mind-body switch, then…
we should treat this as usual. So, we ignore the discount.
Darshana
Darshana
41:51
Yeah, here you don't have any,
Payments for coaches, or anything like… anyone like that, right?
Jay
Jay
41:59
No, this one we repay as normal. For everyone.
Darshana
Darshana
42:04
Oh, that didn't shoot there.
Jay
Jay
42:06
Yeah, that's where the difficulty is, but you can filter by the memo. So, anything that's an actual discount will have the word discount in it.
There are a few exceptions, which I've also included on that brief sheet.
But, MindBodySwitch is a good example where everyone should be paid as usual.
Darshana
Darshana
42:30
That is the only scenario, we are going to pay for purchase, when we… when the scenario is applicable for a discount.
Jay
Jay
42:43
So there are a few codes.
like, in the past, Ashina, I didn't realize that we were gonna build this software, so I didn't know the ramifications of the naming. There are a few old codes that fall in this category as well, and I've given you the list.
Darshana
Darshana
43:00
Okay, is there any possibility that, we can standardize from your system?
Jay
Jay
43:05
Yes, I can't do it for the past.
Darshana
Darshana
43:09
But I can do it for the future.
Okay.
Jay
Jay
43:13
So I will… for now, any new co… and ever since we've had this conversation, like, a few months ago, I standardized, so if it has the word discount in it, then that means it's a real discount, and we apply it properly. If it's something where I'm just trying to input something and…
You know, give them a free class.
Darshana
Darshana
43:38
Yeah, I got. I will, yeah, just send me the, memos, Jay. Yeah, sure. Then I will, remove that from the court.
Jay
Jay
43:47
Copy. Okay, will do.
Yeah, I'll send you an updated memo, because there's a few new, A few new things.
Darshana
Darshana
43:55
Okay.
Right. So, then payment verification is that.
Awww.
And I'm in the process of improving this, verification summary area.
Jay
Jay
44:15
Okay.
Darshana
Darshana
44:16
You can, you know, have a summary of the information, so it is not finalized yet.
And, there you will have the, coach payments.
This is also, I need to, you know, check and finalize the formulas and everything. This is not finished yet.
Jay
Jay
44:40
So…
Darshana
Darshana
44:42
And BGM and, all these… Hi, Seth.
So, probably by, I'm planning to finish this, all tabs by tomorrow.
And then, once we finalize all these four tabs.
Then go to the reports, because, reports will take, like, 5 to 6 hours.
So, it's not a big deal. So, once we finalized the calculations and the mechanism.
And manage the exceptions that we discussed, so…
We just need to, finalize a format for these… Reports?
And, finalize the coding.
So we're almost there.
Jay
Jay
45:30
Solid plan. I like it.
Darshana
Darshana
45:31
Yeah, yeah.
So, do you have any, questions, Jay?
Jay
Jay
45:38
Not for now, yeah, if you could send me over the…
link, I can then update the… so I've got 3 things to do, right? I need to, update the rules, update the coaches.
And, send you a summary of all the discounts, and how they work.
Darshana
Darshana
45:58
Okay, so, I'm going to send you the…
description. This one, I already sent you the same,
Jay
Jay
46:08
The front end I have yet, but I just don't have the.
Darshana
Darshana
46:10
Yeah, that's… yeah, that's the link, that's the link for the app, Jay. Same app.
Yeah, if you need to, if you need to have a custom name.
You can, obtain a name from, GoReady or anything like that?
and send it to me, then I can change it for you, but it seems.
Jay
Jay
46:31
Okay, well, we have a website, so it'd be nice if it was incorporated in the website, but no big deal for now.
Darshana
Darshana
46:38
Okay.
Then I will, send this to you. At any given time, you can change that.
Jay
Jay
46:43
Yeah, great.
Darshana
Darshana
46:45
Okay.
