# REMOVED: Attendance Verification System

## Overview
This document records the complete Attendance Verification system that was removed as requested. The system was responsible for verifying attendance records against payment data and managing the verification workflow.

## How It Worked

### Core Components

#### 1. PaymentVerificationService (`backend/src/services/paymentVerificationService.ts`)

**Main Class**: `PaymentVerificationService`
- **Constructor**: Initializes GoogleSheetsService
- **Main Method**: `verifyPayments()` - Orchestrates the entire verification process

**Key Methods**:
1. `verifyPayments(params)` - Main verification orchestrator
2. `filterByDateRange()` - Filters data by date parameters
3. `parseDate()` - Converts date strings to Date objects
4. `extractDiscountDataFromPayments()` - Extracts discount information
5. `processPaymentVerification()` - Processes payment records with discount classification
6. `processAttendanceVerification()` - Matches attendance with payments
7. `calculateSummary()` - Generates comprehensive verification metrics

**Data Structures**:
- `VerificationRow`: Attendance record with verification status
- `PaymentVerificationRow`: Payment record with category and verification status
- `VerificationSummary`: Comprehensive metrics and breakdowns

#### 2. Verification Routes (`backend/src/routes/verification.ts`)

**Endpoints**:
1. `GET /api/verification/summary` - Get verification summary for date range
2. `GET /api/verification/unverified-invoices/:customer` - Get unverified invoices for customer
3. `POST /api/verification/manual-verify-attendance` - Manually verify attendance record
4. `POST /api/verification/update-payment-category` - Update payment category
5. `GET /api/verification/invoice-status/:invoice` - Get invoice verification status
6. `POST /api/verification/enhanced` - Enhanced verification with discount integration

#### 3. Legacy Verification Routes (`backend/api/verification.js`)

**JavaScript Implementation** with similar functionality:
- Google Sheets authentication
- Data filtering and processing
- Verification logic
- Manual verification capabilities

### Verification Process Flow

#### 1. Data Retrieval
- Reads from Google Sheets: 'attendance' and 'Payments' sheets
- Filters data based on date range (fromDate, toDate, month, year)
- Handles missing or invalid data gracefully

#### 2. Payment Processing
- **Category Classification**:
  - Payment: Standard payment records
  - Discount: Negative amounts with discount memo
  - 100% Discount: Same day, same customer, opposite sign amounts
  - Tax: Payments with 'fee' in memo
  - Refund: Negative payments
  - Fee: Administrative fees

- **Verification Status**:
  - Automatic verification for tax/fee payments
  - Manual verification for complex cases
  - Discount detection and classification

#### 3. Attendance Matching
- Matches attendance records with payment records
- Uses Customer and Date as matching criteria
- Calculates effective amounts considering discounts
- Determines coach payment types (full, partial, free)

#### 4. Summary Calculation
- **Attendance Metrics**:
  - Total, verified, unverified record counts
  - Verification completion rate
  - Manual verification tracking

- **Payment Metrics**:
  - Category breakdowns
  - Financial totals (verified, unverified, discounted, tax)
  - Payment verification rates

- **Discount Analysis**:
  - Total, full, partial, free discount counts
  - Effective amount calculations
  - Coach payment type distribution

### Manual Verification Features

#### 1. Manual Attendance Verification
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/verification/manual-verify-attendance`
- **Process**:
  1. Receives attendanceId, invoiceNumber, customer
  2. Updates attendance record with 'Manually Verified' category
  3. Links attendance to invoice number
  4. Updates related payment records
  5. Sets verification status to 'Verified'

#### 2. Payment Category Updates
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/verification/update-payment-category`
- **Process**:
  1. Receives paymentId, category, customer, invoice
  2. Updates payment record category
  3. Updates timestamp
  4. Persists changes to Google Sheets

#### 3. Invoice Status Tracking
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/verification/invoice-status/:invoice`
- **Features**:
  - Tracks verification status per invoice
  - Calculates verified vs unverified amounts
  - Provides detailed payment breakdown
  - Status types: not_found, fully_verified, unverified, partially_verified

### Integration Points

#### 1. Google Sheets Integration
- **Service**: `GoogleSheetsService`
- **Sheets Used**:
  - 'attendance': Attendance records
  - 'Payments': Payment records
- **Operations**:
  - Read data with error handling
  - Clear and write updated data
  - Handle authentication and permissions

#### 2. Discount Service Integration
- **Service**: `discountService`
- **Features**:
  - Extract discount data from payments
  - Classify discount types
  - Calculate effective amounts
  - Determine coach payment eligibility

#### 3. API Service Integration
- **Frontend Service**: `apiService` in `frontend/src/services/api.ts`
- **Methods**:
  - `getVerificationSummary()`: Fetch summary data
  - `getUnverifiedInvoices()`: Get customer invoices
  - `manuallyVerifyAttendance()`: Manual verification
  - `updatePaymentCategory()`: Update payment categories
  - `getInvoiceStatus()`: Check invoice status
